Ever tried a QOTD bot in your Discord server, but wanted something a bit different? That's where this bot comes in!

On This Day is a Discord bot that sends a historical event that happened on this day... every day!

Currently, this bot has no public invite link, but this is subject to change further down the line. I'm still working on it!

*Powered by Node.js, Discord.js, ZenQuotes's "On This Day" API, and built in TypeScript.*
